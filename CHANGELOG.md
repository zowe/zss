## `2.9.0`
- Bugfix: expose the version of the ZIS dynamic linkage base plugin so it can be updated during a build
- Disable the ZIS dynamic linkage plugin as it's not needed by default

## `2.8.0`

- Feature: Added the API /datasetCopy to copy the datasets
- Enhancement: /datasetMetadata now returns prime, secnd, and space fields for showing the primary and secondary extent sizes and the unit type for them. (#582)
- Enhancement: ZSS dataset creation api now supports space values of "BYTE", "KB", and "MB" instead of just "CYL" and "TRK"
- Bugfix: change conflicting message IDs in the ZIS dynamic linkage base plugin

## `2.7.0`

- Enhancement: A new ZIS plugin, "ZISDYNAMIC" is available within the LOADLIB as ZWESISDL. This plugin allows for ZIS plugins to access utility functions of the zowe-common-c libraries without needing to statically build them into the plugin itself.
- Enhancement: New REST endpoint that maps distributed username to RACF user ID.
- Bugfix: Fixed /unixfile/metadata not working when URL encoded spaces were present in file names

## `2.5.0`

- Bugfix: In 2.3 and 2.4, 'safkeyring://' syntax stopped working, only allowing 'safkeyring:////'. Now, support for both is restored.

- Update the dynamic linkage stub vector to include new functions
- Add ZIS plugin development documentation and samples

## `2.4.0`

- Enhancement: ZSS /datasetContents now has a PUT API for creating datasets.
- Enhancement: ZIS dynamic linkage support

## `2.3.0`

- Enhancment: ZSS now utilizes the configuration parameters present in the zowe configuration file via the configmgr, simplifying the startup of ZSS and increasing the validation of its parameters. The file zss/defaults.yaml shows the default configuration parameters of zss, in combination with the schema of the parameters within zss/schemas, though some parameters are derived from zowe-wide parameters or from other components when they involve those other components.
- Enhancement: Improved startup time due to using the configmgr to process plugin registration, and only when the app-server is not enabled, as the app-server does the same thing.
- Bugfix: Fixed an 0C4 error within the /unixfile API in 31 bit mode. This was preventing files from being shown in the editor.
- Bugfix: 0C4 error messages from dataservices are now shown under the SEVERE log instead of the DEBUG log, so that issues can be spotted more easily.
- Bugfix: 0C4 when lht hashmap functions were called with negative key

## `2.0.0`

- Breaking change: Cookie name now has a suffix which includes the port or if in an HA instance, the HA ID.
- Enhancement: New configuration option that allows to run 64-bit ZSS
- Bugfix: Do not use "tee" when log destination is /dev/null
