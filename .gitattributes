# Binary files, selected by file extension.
#
# Note that "Binary" really just means "Not touched when moved
# between the git repository and the working tree." In some cases
# these are actually UTF-8 or CP1251 (the usual Windows code page).
#
# If you don't have these in your tree, removing these from the
# .gitattributes file will speed up git's processing a bit.
#
# While it would make sense to have BINARY be BINARY on all platforms,
# Other platforms don't use the BINARY term, But do recognize "binary" macro
